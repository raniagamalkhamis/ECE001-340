<tr><th>KERNEL</th><td><p>The kernel gives one of the most fundamental level of control over all the computer’s hardware devices. The kernel is the central 
component of an operating system (OS). It is the component of the operating system that loads initially, and it lingers in main memory. It manages memory 
accessibility for programs in the RAM, it establishes which programs get access to which hardware resources. It establishes or resets the CPU’s 
operating states for optimum operation in all times.</p></td></tr>
<tr><th>PROCESS EXECUTION</th><td><p>The operating system offers an interface in between an application program and the hardware, so that an application 
program can connect with the hardware just by following principles and procedures configured into the operating system. Executing an application program 
includes the creation of a process by the operating system kernel which appoints memory space and various other resources.</p></td></tr>
<tr><th>INTERRUPT</th><td><p>Interrupts are primary to operating systems, as they offer a reliable method for the operating system to interact with 
and respond to its environment. An interrupt is a signal from a device connected to a computer system or from a program within the computer system 
that needs the operating system to quit and determine exactly what to do next. When an interrupt is received, the computer’s hardware automatically
 puts on hold whatever program is presently running, saves its status, and runs computer system code formerly associated with the interrupt.</p></td></tr>
<tr><th>MEMORY MANAGEMENT</th><td><p>This makes sure that a program does not conflict with memory currently being used by an additional program. 
Since programs time share, each program has to have independent access to memory. To puts it simply, the MMU is in charge of all aspects of memory 
management. It is normally integrated right into the cpu, although in some systems it takes up a separate IC (integrated circuit) chip.</p></td></tr>
<tr><th>MULTITASKING</th><td><p>Multitasking describes the operating of multiple independent computer programs on the same computer system. The operating 
system has the ability to keep an eye on where you are in these jobs and go from one to the various other without losing information. Since a lot of 
computers can do at most one or two things at once, this is usually done using time-sharing, which means that each program utilizes a share of the 
computer’s time to perform.</p></td></tr>
<tr><th>NETWORKING</th><td><p>The processors interact with each other via communication lines called network. The communication-network design should 
consider routing and connection techniques, and the troubles of opinion and safety and security. Presently most operating systems sustain a range of 
networking methods, hardware, and applications for using them. This implies that computers running different operating systems could take part in a 
common network for sharing resources such as computing, data, printers, and scanners making use of either wired or wireless connections.</p></td></tr>
<tr><th>SECURITY</th><td><p>If a computer systems has several individuals and enables the simultaneous operation of multiple processes, then the 
numerous processes have to be secured from each other’s activities. A computer system being safe and secure depends upon a variety of technologies 
working effectively. A modern-day operating system offers access to a number of resources, which are readily available to software working on the 
system, and to external devices like networks by means of the kernel.</p></td></tr>
<tr><th>USER INTERFACE</th><td><p>It is everything created into an information device with which an individual might interact. The user interface 
is generally described as a shell and is vital if human communication is to be supported. The user interface checks out the directory framework 
and requests services from the operating system that will obtain information from input hardware devices and demands operating system services 
to display prompts, status messages and such on output hardware devices. </p></td></tr>
