<dt><h3>Unix</h3></dt>
<dd><p>Unix was originally written in assembly language.  Ken Thompson wrote B, mainly based on BCPL, based on his experience in the MULTICS project.
B was replaced by C, and Unix, rewritten in C, developed into a large, complex family of inter-related operating systems which have been influential 
in every modern operating system</p></dd>

<dd><p>macOS (formerly "Mac OS X" and later "OS X") is a line of open core graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Apple Inc., 
the latest of which is pre-loaded on all currently shipping Macintosh computers. macOS is the successor to the original classic Mac OS, 
which had been Apple's primary operating system since 1984. Unlike its predecessor, macOS is a UNIX operating system built on technology
